# MScProject_GreekVase
For my MSc in EEC, Imperial College London

Contains R script, tPCA script (by Arianna Salili-James) and Rev Scripts that I used for my project on the phylogeny of greek vases.
CSVs of tPCAs must be converted into nexus format, which I did manually in notepad++, these can then be read into .rb files for phylogenetic analysis
